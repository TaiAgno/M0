# M0

For Mission 0, I have created the webpage using basic HTML and mostly the Bootstrap framework.
It was a lot of trial and error using the utilities available from the Bootstrap library, a great exercise.

Flex, columns and grid were used to control position and alignment of containers.

3 custom CSS added to:
1. Logo size and position in the Navbar
2. Add dark mask to the background image of the top container
3. Attemp to control better the transition between breakpoints of screen size of the card title on the top container - it does not seem to have worked

My goal was to match as much as possible the provided wireframe, including spaces, sizes and positioning.
